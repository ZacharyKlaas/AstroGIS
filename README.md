AstroGIS
========

This is a repository for files relating to AstroGIS, a concept for programming a Geographic Information System software using a 3D approach and based on the Earth-Centred-Earth-Fixed (ECEF) coordinate system.

The initial concept of this project was:
  * to create a GIS system with code that is easily edited by those who are not experienced programmers; and,
  * to specifically create a GIS system which understands geographic reality in three dimensions, rather than the 
    conventional two-dimensional approach (that is, one which understands things in terms of different flat map
    projection systems).

Towards the first end, this is a project which has been coded in the C++-based "Simple" language, which is written for young programmers (middle school/junior high school or high school age), in order to encourage those less-inclined to use more complex languages to contribute to GIS design.

Towards the second end, the project has also been coded in Python, a more standard language for GIS applications at the current time.  Porting of code to other languages is encouraged as well, particularly those used to create web-based or platform-independent applications, such as Java or Javascript, or those used more extensively in the statistics and GIS community, such as R.

//this finds the extent boundaries for the coverage
//BY TRACKING WHAT THE LOWEST AND HIGHEST VALUES OF FOR THE X AND Y
//COORDINATES OF THE POLYGON ARE, WE CAN "DRAW A VIRTUAL BOX" AROUND
//THE POLYGON.  THE CENTRE INSIDE THAT BOX IS THE POINT AROUND WHICH
//WE MUST DRAW THE POLYGONS.  (DRAWING THE REAL CENTROID FOR THE
//POLYGON MIGHT NOT ACCOMPLISH MUCH FOR US, AS A REAL CENTROID CAN 
//OFTEN FALL OUTSIDE OF A POLYGON, AND WE ARE ONLY CONCERNED HERE WITH 
//HAVING A POINT TO LOCATE THE CENTRE OF THE DISPLAY AREA.)
